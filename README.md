#SimpleTodo App  

Author: Robert M. Vunabandi  

This is a basic to do app. Can add and remove items. More updates to (maybe) come...

##Details

This took me from end of lunch up to 4:00PM. So, from 1:00PM to 4:00PM, that is about 3 hours.

Stories (Criterias) completed:
* CAN ADD ITEMS
* CAN REMOVE ITEMS
* DISPLAY MESSAGE AFTER ADDING ITEM

Things that I wish to add:
* CLICK ON A DELETE CROSS INSTEAD OF LONG PRESS
* SOMEHOW, MESSAGE DOES NOT SHOW ON DELETE, ADD IT
* ADD PRIORITIES
* SUB LISTS
