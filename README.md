# SimpleTodo App

**SimpleTodo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Time spemt: from 1:00PM to 4:00PM, that is about **3 hours**.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Click on a delete cross to delete instead of long press (which I thought was a bit annoying)
* [X] Show a message on delete
* [ ] Add priorities
* [ ] Add sub lists

## Notes

Understanding how the android app works was a bit challenging, but it's very elegant even though it does not all make sense. For some reason, I tried to "System.out.println" one of variables with "R.string.stringName", but that did not work for some reasons. Otherwise, the app was fun to build.
